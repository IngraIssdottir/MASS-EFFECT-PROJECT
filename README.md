# MASS-EFFECT-PROJECT
This project is the creation of a web page using React components, SASS partials, and a backend with an Express server and a database.
The main purpose of this project is practice: reviewing and reinforcing everything I learned during the bootcamp by building a web application from scratch.

I am revisiting the full development process using:

· HTML
· CSS
· SASS (partials)
· React
· Express
· MySQL
· External tools and services such as Aiven and Postman

## Project Structure

The page has (or will have):
· A landing page with a navigation menu
· Four different main sections
· A detail page inside the Characters section

## Development Plan

The project is being developed step by step:

1. First, I create a small array of objects directly in React and fetch data from it.

2. Then, I move that data to the server and fetch it through API endpoints.

3. Finally, I connect the project to a database to retrieve the data from there.

The final goal is to host the database on **Aiven**, deploy the backend on **Render**, and deploy the frontend on **GitHub Pages**, so the project can be fully live.
